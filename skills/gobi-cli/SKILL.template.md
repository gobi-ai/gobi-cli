  Manage the Gobi collaborative knowledge platform from the command line.
  Gobi space is the user's main channel for social interactions and engaging with
  the outside world — checking what's happening, reading and writing threads,
  and collaborating with others.
  Use when the user wants to interact with Gobi spaces, vaults, brains, threads,
  sessions, or brain updates.

# gobi-cli

A CLI client for the Gobi collaborative knowledge platform (v{{VERSION}}).

## Prerequisites

Verify the CLI is installed:

```bash
gobi --version
```

If not installed:

```bash
npm install -g @gobi-ai/cli
```

Or via Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap gobi-ai/tap && brew install gobi
```

## Key Concepts

- **Space**: A shared space for a group or community. A logged-in user can be a member of one or more spaces. A space contains threads, sessions, brain updates, and connected vaults.
- **Vault**: A filetree storage of information and knowledge. A local directory becomes a vault when it contains `.gobi/settings.yaml` with a vault slug and a space slug. Each vault is identified by a slug (e.g. `brave-path-zr962w`).
- **Brain**: Another name for a vault when referring to its AI-searchable knowledge. You can search brains, ask them questions, and publish a `BRAIN.md` document to configure your vault's brain.

## First-Time Setup

The CLI requires three setup steps: authentication, vault initialization, and space selection.

### Step 1: Initialize (Login + Vault)

```bash
gobi init
```

This is an **interactive** command that:
1. Logs in automatically if not already authenticated (opens a browser URL for Google OAuth)
2. Prompts the user to select an existing vault or create a new one
3. Writes `.gobi/settings.yaml` in the current directory with the chosen vault slug
4. Creates a `BRAIN.md` file if one doesn't exist

### Step 2: Select a Space

```bash
gobi space warp
```

This is an **interactive** command that prompts the user to select a space from their available spaces, then saves it to `.gobi/settings.yaml`.

After both steps, `.gobi/settings.yaml` will contain:
```yaml
vaultSlug: brave-path-zr962w
selectedSpaceSlug: cmds
```

### Standalone Login

If the user only needs to log in (without vault setup):

```bash
gobi auth login
```

Check auth status anytime:

```bash
gobi auth status
```

**Important for agents**: Before running any `space` command, check if `.gobi/settings.yaml` exists in the current directory with both `vaultSlug` and `selectedSpaceSlug`. If the vault is missing, guide the user through `gobi init`. If only the space is missing, guide the user through `gobi space warp`. These commands require user input (interactive prompts), so the agent cannot run them silently. Note: `gobi brain` and `gobi session` commands also support `--space-slug` overrides.

## Gobi Space — Community Channel

`gobi space` is the main interface for interacting with the user's Gobi community. When the user asks about what's happening, what others are discussing, or wants to engage with their community — use `gobi space` commands. Think of it as the user's community feed and communication hub.

## Gobi Brain — Knowledge Management

`gobi brain` commands manage your vault's brain: search across all spaces, ask brains questions, and publish/unpublish your BRAIN.md.

## Gobi Session — Conversations

`gobi session` commands manage your conversations: list, read, reply to, and update sessions.

## Important: JSON Mode

For programmatic/agent usage, always pass `--json` as a **global** option (before the subcommand) to get structured JSON output:

```bash
gobi --json space list-threads
```

or

```bash
gobi --json session list
```

JSON responses have the shape `{ "success": true, "data": ... }` on success or `{ "success": false, "error": "..." }` on failure.

## Space Slug Override

Most `space`, `brain`, and `session` commands use the space from `.gobi/settings.yaml`. Override it with:

```bash
gobi space --space-slug <slug> list-threads
gobi brain --space-slug <slug> ask --vault-slug <vaultSlug> --question "..."
gobi session --space-slug <slug> list
```
